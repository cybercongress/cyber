- good explanation on fundamental difference between [[knowledge graphs]] and [[llms]]

- TODO [[create visualization]]
- insights are the following
	- [[knowledge graphs]] and [[llms]] are fundamentally different
	- [[knowledge graphs]] and [[llms]] must interact in any [[intelligent]] system
	- [[knowledge graphs]] and [[llms]] are the key to [[superintelligence]]
- in the context of this article cybergraph describe
	- topology of [[knowledge graph]] defined by [[cybergraph]]
	- weights in [[knowledge graph]] computed by [[relevance machine]]
- that practically means that
	- [[probabilistic model]] produced by [[relevance machine]]
	- is beautiful counterpart for [[llm]] in a modern [[soft3]] [[stack]]
