- in current [[go-cyber]] implementation there is one property
- which significantly limits utility of [[cybergraph]]
- it is inability to create the same [[cyberlink]] second time
- the protocol return [[error]] in this case
- initially it was done in order to protect [[cyberank]] from [[sybil attacks]]
- with formation of [[knowledge theory]]
- its become obvious that two [[cyberlinks]] created in different time
- are fundamentally different [[cyberlinks]]
- allowing this on protocol level we unlock powerful model of usage: [eav model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93attribute%E2%80%93value_model#:~:text=An%20entity%E2%80%93attribute%E2%80%93value%20model,unforeseeable%20using%20a%20fixed%20design.)
- in a proposed model [[cyberrank]] must be accounted for each unique [[cyberlink]]
- without validation of uniqueness on creation
