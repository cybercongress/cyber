- in [[cyber]] neurons are fundamental
	- [[neuron]] use [[spell]] to [[sign]] and [[cast]] [[signal]]
	- and as result are able to do literally anything
- in [[bostrom]] and [[spacepussy]] standard [cosmos-sdk](https://docs.cosmos.network/) addresses are used as neurons
	- support all [[cyber-sdk]] and [[cosmos-sdk]] [[signal types]]
	- support [[semantic neural proofs]]
- some software to create and use [[neurons]]
	- [[kelpr]] in [[cosmos]] and [[cyber]]
	- [[frame]] in [[ethereum]]
- in [[cyb/portal]] you can connect any [[cyber]], [[ethereum]] and [[cosmos]] [[neuron]] to [[avatar]]
