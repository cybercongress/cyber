- allow [[neuron]] to stake on [[particles]] and gain rewards
- staking
	- default is to stake on all [[particles]] made by [[neuron]]
	- optional parameter: choose [[particle]] for staking
- on staking [[neuron]] receives tokens in pool
	- no time bounds
	- one pool for all [[particles]]
- any time [[neuron]] can unstake from [[particle]]
- the pool collect fee from moving [[$A]]
- any time [[neuron]] can collect rewards by burning pool tokens
- effect is [[cyberank]] computation is based only on staking balances not liquid
- proposed mechanism enable a lot of use cases related to custom weighting
