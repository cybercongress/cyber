- in [[bostrom/genesis]] we allocated 70% of $BOOT and $CYB for [[cybergift]]
- current state of public affairs:
	- [[cybergift]] multisig under [[cybercongress]] control: 603T [[$BOOT]] and 700T [[$C]]
	- transfered to [[cybergift]] by [[cybercongress]]: 97T [[$BOOT]]
	- released or releasable [[cybergift]]: 58T [[$BOOT]]
	- [[cybergift]] [[prog]]: claimed 148T [[$BOOT]]
	- [[senate]]: ~56T [[$BOOT]] and 50T [[$C]]
	- [[great web foundation]] multisig under [[cybercongress]] control: 50T [[$BOOT]] and [[$C]]
	- [[avatar]] [[prog]] under [[cybercongress]] multisig: ~9T [[$BOOT]]
-
- my proposal is two understand how could be transition from here
- to the state which we want to see in a smart being
-
- basic approach takes the idea of [[power law distribution]] to target biggest clusters of [[cap]]
	- long tail is owned by all [[neurons]]
		- more than 42%
		- less than 51%
	- [[neuron of bostrom]]
		- offers amazing perspective on the key feature of [[superintelligence]]
		- [[tokens]] owned by [[bootloader]] itself without external interference
		- max 33%, optimal 27%
	- [[senate]]
		- [[tokens]] owned and managed by [[neurons]]
		- ~13%
	- [[congress]]
		- founders [[prog]]
		- ~7%
	- [[great web foundation]]
		- externally controlled stake, e.g. by [[ethereum]]
		- ~5%
-
- [[rethink gift]] is highly relevant for discussion
