alias:: collective intelligence theory, collective artificial intelligence

- scientific field, which examines how
	- groups of individuals collaborate and pool their [[knowledge]] and [[tokens]]
	- to [[solve problems]], [[make decisions]], and generate [[knowledge]]
- foundations are built on principles from: biology, sociology, psychology, computer science, and economics
- [[cyber]] built collective artificial intelligence system
- this short list of articles explain how [[cyber]] apply the most fundamental concepts observed in nature
- ## key concepts
	- [[consensus]]
	- [[collective memory]]
	- [[distributed cognition]]
	- [[diversity]]
	- [[coordination]]
	- [[cooperation]]
	- [[self-organization]]
	- [[stigmergy]]
	- [[emergence]]
- ## key algorithms
	- [[delphi method]]
	- [[random walk]]
	- [[trust systems]]
	- [[cooperative games]]
	- [[prediction markets]]
	- [[truth machine]]
	- more to embrace
	  collapsed:: true
		- swarm intelligence
		- genetic algorithms
		- crowd sourcing

	- `c` as measure of collective intelligence
	- according to woolley is not correlated withÂ `c`
		- team cohesion
		- motivation
		- satisfaction
	- they claim that factors were found as significant correlates
		- the variance in the number of speaking turns
		- group members average social sensitivity
		- proportion of females => women are collectively smarter
		- providing multiple team members the chance to speak up made a group more intelligent
		- groups that are moderately diverse inÂ [cognitive style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_style)
			- have higher collective intelligence
			- than those who are very similar in cognitive style or very different
