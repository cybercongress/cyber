alias:: collective intelligence theory

- scientific field, which examines how
	- groups of individuals collaborate and pool their [[knowledge]] and [[tokens]]
	- to solve problems, make decisions, and create new [[knowledge]]
- foundations are built on principles from: biology, sociology, psychology, computer science, and economics
- ## key concepts
	- [[consensus]]
	- [[self-organization]]
	- [[diversity]]
	- [[distributed cognition]]
	- [[stigmergy]]
	- [[coordination]]
	- [[cooperation]]
	- [[emergence]]
- ## key algorithms
	- [[delphi method]]
	- [[trust systems]]
	- [[cooperative games]]
	- [[prediction markets]]
	- more to embrace
	  collapsed:: true
		- swarm intelligence
		- genetic algorithms
		- crowd sourcing
		- collaborative filtering
		- ensemble learning
		- network analysis
- basic evidence which is interesting
  collapsed:: true
	- `c` as measure of collective intelligence
	- according to woolley is not correlated with `c`
		- team cohesion
		- motivation
		- satisfaction
	- they claim that factors were found as significant correlates
		- the variance in the number of speaking turns
		- group members average social sensitivity
		- proportion of females => women are collectively smarter
		- providing multiple team members the chance to speak up made a group more intelligent
		- groups that are moderately diverse in [cognitive style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_style)
			- have higher collective intelligence
			- than those who are very similar in cognitive style or very different
- collective intelligence of [[bostrom]] and [[spacepussy]] offers simpler [[learning]]
- discover all [[concepts]]
