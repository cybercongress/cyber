alias:: rm

- unique [[vm]] for [[soft3]] computations
- offers [[probabilistic collective computations]]
- arhitecture
	- input
		- [[will]] of [[neurons]]
		- [[attention]] of [[neurons]]
		- [[cyberlinks]] created by [[neurons]]
	- computation on [[gpu]] in [[consensus]]
		- [[black magic]]
	- output
		- [[particles weight]]
		- [[cyberlinks weight]]
		- [[neurons weight]]
		- [[syntropy]] of [[vimputer]]
- powerful property of rm is [[no gas fees]] for [[learning]]
- instead rm offer to use [[$V]] token for [[bandwidth subscription]]
- all [[cyberlinks]] consume [[bandwidth]] which recovers with [[time]]
- TODO [[create visualization]]
- in essence rm
	- provided with enormous primitively structured input
	- can provide comprehensive model of the universe
	- with [[strong predictive power]]
- [[supported gpu]]
- discover all [[concepts]]
