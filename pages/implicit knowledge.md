- [[information]] that is not directly stated
- but can be inferred from the [[explicit knowledge]] in the [[cybergraph]]
- orthogonal to [[explicit knowledge]]
- explanation
	- if  `apple` is linked with `fruit`
	- and `fruit` is linked with `food`
	- then we can implicitly infer that `apple` somehow linked to `food`
- processed by [[relevance machine]]
- in [[cyber-sdk]] implicit knowledge can be inferred using
	- [[standard inference]]
	- [[cosmwasm]] [[progs]]
	- TODO autonomous [[thoughts]]
	- TODO and queried over [[ibc]]
- in [[cybs-ts]] implicit knowledge can be infered using
	- [[datalog]]: ai oriented query language
	- [[rune]]: powerful dynamic scripting
	- TODO [[webgpu]]: local hardware independent parallel execution
