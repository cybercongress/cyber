- [[information]] that is not directly stated
- but can be inferred from the [[explicit knowledge]] in the [[cybergraph]]
- orthogonal to [[explicit knowledge]]
- explanation
	- if  `apple` is linked with `fruit`
	- and `fruit` is linked with `food`
	- then we can implicitly infer that `apple` somehow linked to `food`
