- cyberlink is directed link between two [[particles]] of [[information]] signed by [[neuron]] and recorded into [[cyber]] [[vimputer]]
- primitive [[learning]] act
- fully authenticated quadruple
	- | block hash | neuron | from particle | to particle |

- foundation of [[cybergraph]]
- basic [[relevance machine]] instruction
- example
	- [who](neuron) linked the data: e.g. [@mastercyb](https://cyb.ai/@mastercyb)
	- [when](consensus computer) data was linked: e.g. [txid](https://cyb.ai/network/bostrom/tx/1D0E26540FE9AFB5F9113826F7BCF650802A010392E22D51F158B1522A958BA1)
	- [[what]] data was linked: [space pussy](https://cyb.ai/oracle/ask/space%20pussy) > [fungi extase](https://cyb.ai/oracle/ask/QmaqXGP6FcjRZhVbFzsGFjJsqSgZva5zJALSL9u5YyS9wS)
	- ![fungi extase](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmaqXGP6FcjRZhVbFzsGFjJsqSgZva5zJALSL9u5YyS9wS)
- now anyone who would search [space pussy](https://cyb.ai/oracle/ask/space%20pussy) must be able to find epic image
- how to create cyberlinks?
	- go to [cyb.ai/oracle/learn](https://cyb.ai/oracle/learn)
	- install [[cy]]
	- or install [[go-cyber]]
- difference with hyperlink
	- you have probably used links which look like this: https://google.com
	- eventually the request to this link resolves to a particular machine which will show your old god
	- you cant know for sure what you get
	- cyberlinks are different
	- link between two pieces of content particles there each content is addressed by its [[hash]]
	- this makes information searchable through the spacetime
- changing the way we [[learn]]
- discover all [[concepts]]
