## marrying topos theory and focus flow computation

### 1. philosophical and mathematical motivation

- **topos theory** gives a unifying categorical framework where different “universes of discourse” (contexts, logics, or worlds) are formalized as categories with internal logic.
- **focus flow computation (ffc)**, as defined in the collective focus theorem (cft) architecture, models attention dynamics on a token-weighted, authenticated, and cryptographically verifiable knowledge graph.
- the **intersection**: a topos can serve as the **semantic layer** for the evolving focus graph, where each object is a “bundle” of possible states/interpretations, and morphisms are focus-preserving transformations.  
- this allows cft/ffc to reason *internally* in different logical universes while still preserving external consistency.

### 2. mapping core cft/ffc entities into a topos

| cft/ffc element                        | topos interpretation |
|----------------------------------------|----------------------|
| particle (content-addressed node)      | object in the topos representing a proposition/data type |
| cyberlink (weighted directed edge)     | morphism in the topos with extra structure for weight and endorsement |
| focus vector π                         | subobject classifier valuation assigning truth-like degree to each object |
| stake / token weight                   | measure object or probability valuation in the internal logic |
| random walk convergence                | sheaf-theoretic colimit or fixed point in the topos of stochastic processes |
| shard / local subgraph                 | subtopos representing a localized internal logic |

### 3. data structures

1. **indexed category of shards**
   - each shard (topic, time slice, or geography) is a slice category `C/X` in the topos.
   - morphisms between shards are **geometric morphisms** preserving structure.
   - enables compositional proofs of focus convergence per shard before global merge.

2. **sheaf of attention weights**
   - assigns to each open set (context) a vector space of π-values with exponential optimality constraints.
   - gluing conditions ensure global π is consistent with all local computations.

3. **internal probabilistic monad**
   - captures stochastic transitions in the internal logic of the topos.
   - implements token-weighted markov chains with authenticated graph proofs.

### 4. algorithms

#### 4.1 topos-aware power iteration
- run π updates **internally** in each subtopos, using local cyberlinks + authenticated proofs.
- use **inverse image functors** of geometric morphisms to pull local π to the global stage.
- global π = colimit of local π vectors, merged via categorical limits to preserve safety invariants.

#### 4.2 focus-preserving morphism pruning
- identify morphisms (cyberlinks) whose removal changes π below a tolerance.
- apply **subobject classifier** logic to detect logically redundant or inconsistent links.

#### 4.3 attention sheaf optimization
- solve for π that maximizes entropy subject to exponential decay constraints across ranks.
- ensure solutions are *global sections* of the sheaf of attention weights.

### 5. security and verification

- **authenticated graph data structures (agds)** ensure that any topos morphism corresponding to a cyberlink can be verified externally.
- privacy-preserving commitments (pedersen, poseidon2) keep the topos’ internal state consistent but hidden unless disclosed.
- categorical pullback diagrams model selective disclosure policies without breaking global consistency.

### 6. example computation flow

1. **local reasoning**:  
   each shard computes π over its subgraph in the internal logic of its topos.
   
2. **proof generation**:  
   shards produce agds proofs for their updates.

3. **global merge**:  
   π-values are lifted via inverse image functors to the ambient topos and colimit-combined.

4. **reward distribution**:  
   Δπ changes are converted to token rewards per the π-minting theorem.

---

### 7. benefits of the merge

- **logical pluralism**: different shards can operate under different internal logics (intuitionistic, probabilistic, quantum) without breaking global coherence.
- **formal verifiability**: topos morphisms + agds proofs guarantee end-to-end correctness.
- **resilience**: categorical structure isolates local faults while preserving global safety theorems.
- **semantic scalability**: enables context-aware computation at planetary scale.

### 8. next steps

1. formalize shard categories and geometric morphisms for focus computation.
2. implement sheaf of π-values with exponential decay constraint solver.
3. integrate topos-indexed agds proofs into the foculus consensus loop.
4. test cross-logic focus merging on simulated heterogeneous graphs.
