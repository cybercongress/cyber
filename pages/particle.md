- [[object]] of [[information]]
- [[neurons]] measure [[information]] by computing [[particle]] from [[file]]
- particle is a format for content identification of data
- essentially, particle, or content address is web3 link
- instead of using the location on the server:
- ```
  https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf
  ```
- we use the object itself:
- ```

  ```
- which generally is [[hash]] of the [[file]]
- content addresses giveÂ [cool properties](https://steemit.com/web3/@hipster/an-idea-of-decentralized-search-for-web3-ce860d61defe5est)for [[superintelligence]]
	- mesh-network future-proof
	- interplanetary accessibility
	- censorship resistance
	- technological independence
	- deduplication
- [[bostrom]] use [[cidv0]] standard of content addressing
	- basically content address is ubiquitous SHA-256 [[hash]]
	- SHA-256 have rich software and hardware infrastructure
- any information can be expressed as [[particle]]
- two linked particles is [[cyberlink]]
- to compute particle from file you can use
	- [[cyb/oracle]] or [[cy]]
	- [[go-ipfs]]
	- any other [[ipfs]] related services
