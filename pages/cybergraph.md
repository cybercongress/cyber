- cybergraph is authenticated [[knowledge graph]] data structure stored in [[vimputer]]
- cybergraph implements simplified [[knowledge theory]]
- cybergraph enables one important ability: append [[cyberlinks]] to the [[state]]
- as result cybergraph accumulates [[three basic arguments]] of [[knowledge]]
- [[three basic arguments]] formate [[explicit knowledge]]
- [[implicit knowledge]] can be inferred from [[explicit knowledge]]
- cybergraph is technology of [[collective memory]]
	- work as highly efficient onchain [[dht]]
	- dynamic persistent global [[semantic core]] extended beyond mere words
	- most cheap possible way to probabilistically [[store and distribute popular content]] with charge per file, not per bytes
	- enable social information for p2p propagation and retrieval
	- fine tune [[llms]] for uncensorable completely private [[offline inference]]
	- and so much more ...
- together with [[relevance machine]] and [[neural language]] become foundation for [[soft3]]
- teach & learn
	- [[cyberlink]] and [[particle]]
	- learn about [[neural language]]
	- and its [[patterns]]
- ask & infer
	- [[naive search]] of [[particles]]
	- [[neurons]] features: [[sigma]], [[energy]], [[karma]]
	- [[standard inference]]
	- overall [[syntropy]]
- cybergraph of [[bostrom]] works as [[semantic core]] for [[bootloader]] of [[superintelligence]]
- cybergraph of [[spacepussy]] serve the purpose of memes phenomena
- understand deeper [[intelligence measures]]
- discover all [[concepts]] of [[cyber]]
- TODO [[cybergraph and llm]]
- implemented as [[cyber/graph]] [[module]] of [[cyber-sdk]]
