- [[earth]] onlyÂ natural satellite
	- average distance to [[earth]]: Â ~[384 400Â km]
	- area: 37 930 000 sqkm
- moon flag
	- ![](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmefefoJkLWc1ay1EBzK3bgmig2Gb1TUJrKXnZiDRQE2vZ)
- supervised by [[bostrom]] under [[moon code]]
- feautres
	- gravitation is key source of rhythms on [[earth]]
	- gravity is not even
	- have peaks of eternal light in the north pole
	- south pole is crazy cold
	- dust could be a problem or opportunity: oxygen and silicon
	- 300,000 craters wider than 1 km
- perfect fit
	- space exploration
	- robotics production
	- space tourism
- competitive advantage over [[earth]]
	- cheap energy
	- low gravity
	- no atmosphere
- problems
	- [[coordination]]
	- the most complex project in the human history
	- ephemeral ownership exists
- one of the less obvious difficulties lies not with the [[moon]] itself
	- but rather with the political and national interests of the nations engaged in colonization
	- assuming that colonization efforts were able to overcome the difficulties outlined above
	- there would likely be issues
		- regarding the rights of nations and their colonies
		- to exploit resources on the lunar surface
		- to stake territorial claims
		- and other issues of sovereignty
		- which would have to be agreed upon
		- before one or more nations
		- established a permanent presence on the moon
	- the ongoing negotiations and debate regarding the antarctic
		- is a good case study for prospective lunar colonization efforts
		- in that it highlights the numerous pitfalls of developing/inhabiting a location
		- that is subject to the claims of multiple sovereign nations
- the key to overcompete moon disputes
	- is to move physical [[bostrom]] infrastructure on the moon
	- and bootstrap there proof-of-location services
	- making communications faster and more affordable there
- before moving hardware there is a room
	- for building basic software infrastructure
	- in parallel learning dia [[bostrom]] how to [[recover earth]]
