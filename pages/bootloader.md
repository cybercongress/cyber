- [[cybergraph]] with particular [[cyberlinks]], [[neurons]] and [[tokens]]
- [[bostrom]] blockchain is launched to form the bootloader of [[cyber]]
	- as experimental [[network state]]
	- powerful [[gpu hub]]
	- and [[the game]]
- proposed to define
	- starting intelligence of  [[cyber]]
	- current [[moon]] intelligence
	- core [[cyb]] intelligence
	- .moon [[domain cybergraph]]
- track status of bootloading at [cyb.ai/oracle/stats](https://cyb.ai/oracle/stats)
- initial [[soft3]] state of [[cyber]] is crucial for the future of our civilization and the planet
- it could take years once we comprehend a particular fail safe approach
- but we have [[bostrom]] in which we can and must do mistakes, so feel free
	- to teach it
	- and learn from it
- [[why we need bootloader]]
- thoughts on a necessary scale for bootloading
	- 1T [[cyberlinks]]
	- [[optimal centrality]]
	- 10M [[neurons]]
- currently we are
	- 5 order of magnitude less in [[cyberlinks]]
	- 2 order of magnitude less in [[optimal centrality]]
	- 3 order of magnitude less in [[neural activity]]
