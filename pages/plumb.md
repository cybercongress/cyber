- what is plumb?
	- plumb is a tool used in construction and surveying to establish a vertical reference or plumb line
	- it typically consists of a weight, often made of metal, attached to the end of a string or cord
	- when suspended from a fixed point, gravity pulls the weight straight down, allowing to find a point directly beneath the fixed point above
	- this simple but precise tool helps ensure structures or elements are vertically true
	- playing a crucial role in building to achieve accurate alignment and balance
