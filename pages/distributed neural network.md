- TODO make visualization of [[soft3]] architecture
- here we present new architecture of distributed neural network
- layers
	- input: [[ask]]
	- [[cyb/soul]]: define default processing rules for processing
	- [[will]] regulated by [[$V]]: limits [[cybergraph]] [[bandwidth]]
	- [[neural]]: expressive semantic language for [[cybergraph]]
	- [[attention]] regulated by [[$A]]: affects probabilities of [[random walk]]
	- [[random walk]] measurements: get probabilities on [[nodes]]
	- [[standard inference]]: compute on gpu [[truthful]] order of particles in [[context]]
	- [[dynamic names]]: ability to map static names to js and wasm code
	- [[cyber-cw]] set of [[semantic cosmwasm]] [[progs]] for [[learning]] during execution
	- processing ordered list of [[particles]] by [[llm]]: local or cloud
	- [[motivation]] driven by [[$O]]: allow to cover cost base of learning through [[learning rewards]]
	- output: [[answer]]
- that is what chatgpt gave me to a query of creating diagram of proposed architecture
	- ![dnn by openai](https://emerald-raw-leopon-384.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmW2VPk3K1AeiUc52gcFqFktTPrxxoKKZqjwG9QsWmVbSZ)
- hopefully proposed architecture will be able to demonstrate better results
