## vision
	- soft that make dreams come true
	- TODO [[browser without tabs]]
- ## mission
	- link and persist knowledge that allows everyone prosper
- ## big idea
	- your browser will evolve to a software defined robot
	- that will merge all you computers in one virtual your very own unstopable mind
	- and will be able to live on even after you are gone
	- read more [[stories of neurons]]
- ## tech tldr
	- browser based on the idea of [[state transition function]] defined by [[cyberlink]]
	- build using [[modern stack]]
	- allow for transition by [[message]]
	- from one state expressed as [[particle]]
	- to another state expressed as [[particle]]
	- and write down transitions to [[cyb/brain]]
- ## main loop
	- you can ask any [[particle]]
	- cyb will resolve input [[particle]] based on logic defined by [[cyb/soul]]
	- and output the new [[particle]] with possible interactions
- ## problems of existing browsers
	- not operation systems but must be
		- no secure memory operations
		- no persistence of data
		- p2p is nearly impossible
	- browsers are stealing your computers resources
		- we don't have the ability to limit how applications can access your computer's resources
		- your computer resources cost money
		- you can provide resources for running decentralized programs to monitize resources otherwise lost
	- browsers and web2 apps are ugly
		- web2 invasive protocols kill experience
		- browsers nowadays do not care about the most important thing
		- keeping your attention
	- there is not a browser built on the perfect technology for this goal: [[rust]]
- ## goals
	- [[xp]]: speed, energy, sex
	- reliable and transparent surfing
	- single source of truth for peoples
	- emotional experience and positive feelings
	- frozen foundation for future generations
	- one app to rule them all => eventually os
	- to be loved by the most
- ## not the goals
	- provide compatibility with legacy web
	- to follow conventional way of doing stuff
	- to be loved by everyone
- ## principles
	- ownership: no keys - no pussy
	- allegality: because i cannot care
	- nonviolence: i follow the golden principle
	- consent: i respect you
	- privacy: because we can
	- efficiency: if something can be done faster at the cost of energy efficiency it must not be done
	- speed: faster is always better than slow
	- offline: travel in spacetime cannot be imagined without offline first experience
	- modularity: i am a limited set of concise interfaces
	- minimalism: if you do not know why to add, do not add
	- transparency: you must be able to understand how i work and why
	- wisdom: you educate me, i educate you
	- fun: i love games and tits
	- universality: i was created for humans, robots, animals, progs, and other living forms
	- frozen foundations: eventually my code will freeze
- ## valuation
	- modern browser must have token valuation strategy
	- our problems of civilization are rooted in our inability to value stuff
	- our value system is broken
	- cyb endorse valuation in fundamental values
- ## privacy
	- we truly believe in privacy
		- privacy is just fundamental right of any thinking beast
		- and is essential ability for our survival
		- is necessary for building [[type 1]] civilization
	- current internet set this requirement as probably the most hardest challenge
		- all protocols from [[ip]] addressing
		- to the [[ethereum]]
		- are revealing nearly all information
	- we will struggle to advance surfing to anonymous behavior by default
- ## gaming
	- its kinda strange that the most critical piece of our software infrastructure is so ugly
	- after 50 years of computing development
	- in the presence of the multibillion gaming industry
	- in the presence of generative ai
	- we build cyb with a deep believe that music, art and the game are essential parts of surfing
- ## ode to [[open source]]
	- how to develop cool browsers without reinventing a wheel?
	- stand on the shoulder of potential giants
	- gather dependencies which become gold standard in the small area
- ## [[join]]
