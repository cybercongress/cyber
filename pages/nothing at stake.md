- potential issue in proof of stake consensus mechanisms
- where validators have little to no disincentive to sign multiple competing blocks
- since they don't risk losing significant resources like in [[proof of work]]
- this can lead to validators supporting multiple forks in [[double signing attack]]
- undermining the integrity and security of the blockchain network
- to mitigate this, mechanisms like [[double sign protection]] are implemented
- to penalize validators who engage in such behavior
- ensuring they have a tangible stake in maintaining the network's consensus
- and discouraging dishonest actions
