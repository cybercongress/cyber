- initially we allocated 70% from [[bostrom/genesis]]
- result in 27 months
	- ~47k citizens with [[avatars]]
	- ~41k gift claims with ~1% reach to initial ~4.4m target audience
	- ~60k [[bostrom]] and [[spacepussy]] [[neurons]]
	- ~90k [[neural proofs]] from [[ethereum]] and [[cosmos]] networks
- how much we spent on this?
	- claimed amount
		- ~148T [[$BOOT]] or
		- ~21% of budget
	- releasable amount
		- ~23T [[$BOOT]] or
		- ~3% of budget
	- released amount
		- ~35T [[$BOOT]] or
		- 5% of budget
- we reach 4.1% from [[global recognition hypothesis]]  needed for widespread of phenomena
- looking back, results are real and present
- but i suggest to stop allocation there
- unless we transform this effort
- into sustainable source of spread, marketing and effort
- basic idea is
	- move management of [[cybergift]] [[prog]] to [[senate]] [[daodao]]
	- use claimed and releasable amount for staking to generate revenue in [[staking pools]]
	- and switch to a more sustainable mechanism to incentivize marketing
		- [[referral system]]
		- [[neural proofs]]
		- [[audience research]]
- 113T [[$BOOT]] that is 9.3% of current stake
- accounting for 51T [[$BOOT]]
	- from [[cybergift]] multisig controlled by [[cybercongress]]
	- which must send in order to cover all current claimed [[$BOOT]]
- together this forms 16.4% stake in [[bostrom]]
- and go under [[senate]] control becoming the biggest force of [[bostrom]]
- some of senate funds allocated to subdao for marketing efforts i discussed
- fading out [[cybercongress]] power and
- moving decentralization of the project further
- read [[finalization of $BOOT distribution]] as part of a series
-
- TODO thorough discussion of rethink share of gift needed
