- process by which [[avatars]] or [[neurons]] within a [[collective intelligence]]
- align their [[actions]], [[decisions]], and [[behaviors]]
- to achieve a [[common goal]] with a help of [[game theory]]
-
- this involves
	- organizing and synchronizing efforts
	- sharing information
	- making decisions
- leverages the collective knowledge, skills, and resources of the group
- effective coordination enhances the groups ability to
	- solve complex problems
	- innovate, and
	- adapt to changing circumstances
- ensure that
	- members work together
	- efficiently and effectively
	- minimizing conflicts and redundancies
-
- key algorithms used in [[cyberverse]]
	- [[consensus]]
	- [[market makers]]
-
- TODO algorithms to research for coordination breakthroughs
	- [[coordination graphs]]
	- [[swarm intelligence algorithms]]
	- [[reinforcement learning]]
	- [[consensus clustering]]
	- [[distributed constraint optimization]]
