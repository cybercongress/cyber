- process by which [[avatars]] or [[neurons]] within a [[collective intelligence]]
- align their actions, decisions, and behaviors
- to achieve a common goal or objective
-
- this involves
	- organizing and synchronizing efforts
	- sharing information
	- making decisions
- leverages the collective knowledge, skills, and resources of the group
- effective coordination enhances the groups ability to
	- solve complex problems
	- innovate, and
	- adapt to changing circumstances
- ensure that
	- members work together
	- efficiently and effectively
	- minimizing conflicts and redundancies
-
- key algorithms
