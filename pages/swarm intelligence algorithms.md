- inspired by the behavior of social animals
- these algorithms guide decentralized coordination among [[agents]]
- examples include
	- [[ant colony optimization]]
		- where agents find optimal paths by simulating the behavior of ants searching for food
	- [[particle swarm optimization]]
		- which simulates the social behavior of birds or fish to find optimal solutions
