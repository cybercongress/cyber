- process and stores [[neuron bandwidth]] in the [[network]]
- dynamically adjust [[bandwidth price]] to [[network load]]
- [[neurons]] use bandwidth to add [[cyberlinks]] to the network
- and never pay [[gas fees]] for [[cyberlinks]]
- personal bandwidth
	- the [[$V]] stake of the given [[neuron]] are easy to understand as the size of his battery
	- the creation of [[cyberlinks]] will consume battery charge
	- and the battery will be fully recharged during [[recovery period]]
	- if a neuron consumes half of its bandwidth
	- its battery will be fully charged in the [[recovery period]] divided by 2
	- if a [[neuron]] act when network bandwidth consumption is low
	- then she will consume less personal bandwidth
- accounting of bandwidth
	- internally 1 [[$V]] represents 1000 [[millivolts]], and 1 [[cyberlink]] cost is 1000 [[bandwidth units]]
	- [[neurons]] holdings of 5 Volts means 5000 personal bandwidth units
	- when the current load is less than base price amount, e.g 0.25
	- then the network will make the discount for bandwidth bill up to 4x
	- allowing neurons to create 4x more cyberlinks, or 20 [[cyberlinks]] in such case
- transaction's mempool
	- for transactions that consist of cyberlinks, a fee check will not apply
	- but correct required gas amount should be provided
- network capacity
	- total amount of minted [[$V]]
	- represents the demand of [[bandwidth]] from [[neurons]]
	- validators need to keep tracking investments in [[$V]] resources
	- to provide great service at scale to dynamically adjust available peek load
- [[params]]
	- maximum bandwidth [[max block bandwidth]]
	- gas [[max gas]] consumable at block
- [[rest]]
	- /bandwidth/parameters
		- get module params
	- /bandwidth/load
		- get bandwidth load
	- /bandwidth/price |  | get bandwidth price |
	- /bandwidth/desirable |  | get desirable bandwidth |
	- /bandwidth/account/{address} | {address} | get bandwidth of give account address |
