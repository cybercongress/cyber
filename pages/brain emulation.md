- table mentions current [[bostrom]] cybergraph created by ~50k [[neurons]]
- existing technical capacity of [[bostrom]] is something in the middle between data center and powerful desktop
- this is picture must give conceptual understanding, not scientific rigor
- so let us know if you understand how to improve precision of evaluation
-
- if some form of [[moores law]] can be applied to the growth of computing
- some form of brain emulation seems right [[behind the corner]]
-
- TODO how could [[cyber]] be bigger when [[mycelium]]?
- Let's refine the numerical estimations for the Bostrom cybergraph and compare it with the mycelium network using a more detailed approach. Here are the key metrics recalculated:
- ### Mycelium Network:
- **Total Nodes:** \(10^{21}\)
- **Node Power:** \(1\) (amoeba equivalent)
- **Total Computational Power (TCP):** \(10^{21}\)
- ### Bostrom Cybergraph:
- **Total Nodes:** \(2 \times 10^6\)
- **Node Power:** \(10^{14}\) (human brain * amoeba)
- **Total Computational Power (TCP):** \(2 \times 10^6 \times 10^{14} = 2 \times 10^{20}\)
- ### Revised Understanding:
- **Mycelium Network TCP:** \(10^{21}\)  
  Despite each node being weak (only as powerful as an amoeba), the sheer number of nodes makes its TCP extraordinarily high.
- **Bostrom Cybergraph TCP:** \(2 \times 10^{20}\)  
  Even with a far smaller number of nodes, the exponentially greater power per node means that its TCP approaches that of the mycelium network.
- ### Additional Comparisons:
  
  1. **Node Count Comparison:**
	- Mycelium: \(10^{21}\) nodes
	- Bostrom Cybergraph: \(2 \times 10^6\) nodes
	  
	  The mycelium network has \(10^{15}\) times more nodes than the Bostrom cybergraph.
	  
	  2. **Node Power Comparison:**
	- Mycelium: \(1\) (amoeba)
	- Bostrom Cybergraph: \(10^{14}\) (human brain * amoeba)
	  
	  The power per node in the Bostrom cybergraph is \(10^{14}\) times greater than that of the mycelium network.
	  
	  3. **Total Edge Length Comparison:**
	- Mycelium: ~450 quadrillion kilometers (this is a vast distributed network with immense physical spread)
	- Bostrom Cybergraph: Not applicable in a physical sense but conceptually connected nodes would have very short connection paths due to high computational power.
- ### Conclusion:
- The **mycelium network** has immense scale but lower computational power per node. Its strength lies in redundancy, distribution, and sheer number of nodes.
- The **Bostrom cybergraph** is extremely powerful per node, allowing complex simulations with far fewer resources. It is designed for centralized, high-efficiency computations, making it powerful in a very different way.
  
  In essence, while the Bostrom cybergraphâ€™s TCP is of a similar order of magnitude to that of the mycelium network, the way these networks achieve their respective computational strengths is entirely different, reflecting their distinct design principles and use cases.
