alias:: whole brain emulation, simulated brains

- whole brain emulation looks feasible at current state of technology
- [[cyberlinks]] offer amazing opportunity for modeling physical and artificial [[brains]]

- this is picture must give conceptual understanding, not scientific rigor
- so let us know if you understand how to improve precision of evaluation
-
- if some form of [[moores law]] can be applied to the growth of computing
- some form of brain emulation seems right [[behind the corner]]
-
- TODO how could [[cyber]] be bigger when [[mycelium]]?
