alias:: pos

- class of [[consensus]] mechanism used in most [[blockchains]]
- [[token]] [[vested staking]] which secure creation of new valid [[blocks]]
- unlike [[proof of work]]
	- which relies on computational power to solve complex mathematical problems
	- pos assigns the right to validate transactions based on the number of tokens a validator holds
	- and is willing to stake as collateral
	- validators are chosen randomly
	- with the probability of being selected typically proportional to the amount of stake they have
- method aims to be more energy-efficient and scalable compared to [[proof of work]]
- pros
	- energy efficiency
		- significantly reduces the energy consumption associated with mining
		- as it doesn't require extensive computational power
	- scalability
		- can handle higher transaction volumes more efficiently
		- making it suitable for large-scale blockchain networks
- cons
	- security
		- security assumption are usually lower with [[honest majority assumption]] ~67%
		- while classical [[nakamoto]] consensus assume 51% acting honestly
	- decentralization
		- [[rich get richer]] problem in pos which is less impactful in [[pow]]
		- [[pow]] leaves minor ability for securing transactions without significant capital
	- fairness
		- pos network does not allow to start a network from 0 token supply by design
		- in this sense [[pow]] is abjectively more fair: enables identical rules for [[vimputer]] lifetime
	- accsability
		- in pos network its impossible to mint tokens without owning any prior tokens
		- [[pow]] is powerful [[transmuter]] enable to bypass existing financial system for onboarding
- proof of stake is implemented in token of leading [[blockchains]]
