- concept that emerges from different fields of science and mathematics, often contrasted with entropy
- while entropy is associated with
	- disorder, randomness, and the tendency of systems
	- to move towards thermodynamic equilibrium
	- syntropy is linked to the oppositeâ€”order, complexity
	- and the tendency of systems to move towards [[organization]] and [[coherence]]
- scientific perspectives
	- thermodynamics
		- while entropy is a central concept in thermodynamics
		- syntropy isn't traditionally a thermodynamic quantity
		- however, it has been used in discussions about living systems
		- which seem to locally decrease entropy through processes like metabolism and growth
		- creating order from disorder
	- biology
		- in biological systems, syntropy may describe the processes that lead
			- [[self-organization]]
			- [[complexity]], and
			- life
		- for example, dna replication, cell differentiation, and the development of organisms
		- can be seen as syntropic processes where order increases
	- [[cybernetics]] and [[systems theory]]
		- study of self-organizing systems
		- these are systems that, instead of degrading into disorder, as entropy would suggest
		- develop increasing levels of [[complexity]] and [[coherence]]
	- quantum mechanics
		- some interpretations of quantum mechanics and theories of time involve syntropy
		- where future states of a system influence the present
		- creating a pull towards organization and coherence
- syntropy vs. entropy
	- while entropy is the force producing [[randmoness]]
	- leading to [[chaos]] and overgrowing extension of the [[universe]]
	- syntropy is the opposite force of [[order]]
	- which is the source of [[intelligence]] counterbalancing the [[chaos]]
