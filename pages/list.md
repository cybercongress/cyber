	- [[creator]]: [[neuron]] with first [[cyberlink]]
	- [[time]]: how long time ago created by active [[neuron]]
		- not the first who [[cyberlink]]
	- [[size]]: amount of bytes
	- [[probability of observation]]
	- [[views]]: sum of incoming and outgoing cyberlinks to [[particle]]
- table must be
	- sortable by [[creator]], [[time]], [[size]], [[probability of observation]], [[views]] in both directions
	- at least 21 rows on the screen
		- managing 1000 positions is impossible if i see 7-10 on screen
	- view index
		- every page during surfing must store last index of row and state of analytics bar
