- table render of [[brain]]
- 3 indicators in the head
	- left:
		- amount of avatars particles
		- battery like indicator displaying % of discovery: `avatar particles / cybergraph particles`
	- center: total size of brain in bytes
	- right:
		- amount of avatars cyberlinks
		- battery like indicator displaying % of discovery: `avatar cyberlinks / cybergraph cyberlinks`
- table of [[particles]] cyberlinked by active [[neuron]] sorted by [[cyberank]] by default
- during surfing all ranks must be stored locally and updated during next visit
- unique particles with last seen ranks is the source of raw list
- fields
	- [[spark]]: render of [[particle]]
	- [[creator]]: [[neuron]] with first [[cyberlink]]
	- [[time]]: how long time ago created by active [[neuron]]
		- not the first who [[cyberlink]]
	- [[size]]: amount of bytes - must provide pin / unpin action
	- [[probability of observation]]
	- [[views]]: sum of incoming and outgoing cyberlinks to [[particle]]
		- on hover: who saw this particle? 5 random avatars in
			- choose the algorithm which is least intensive: random, last, top, etc.
- table must be
	- sortable by [[creator]], [[time]], [[size]], [[probability of observation]], [[views]] in both directions
	- at least 21 rows on the screen
		- managing 1000 positions is impossible if i see 7-10 on screen
	- view index
		- every page during surfing must store last index of row and state of analytics bar
		- must change parameter in url
		- i must be able to see exact position fast in previous view after hitting back
- actions
	- default button: add one particle
		- on add create a cyberlink [[particle]] -> `like`
	- multilink
		- choose several particles
		- button for cyberlink with two options: in or out
	- aka delete particle
		- create cyberlink: [[particle]] -> `delete`
		- do not display deleted particles except on `delete` particle page globally
	- LATER: custom sorting
