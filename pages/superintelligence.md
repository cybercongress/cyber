- computer that is smarter then all humans combined
- term coined by [[nick bostrom]] in [his book](https://cyb.ai/ipfs/QmYHo4oKHvm33pPnou9M1iRww2PYQu9Kmb3DWJ4DJgrUkb)
- according to [[nick bostrom]] there are four major paths of creating superintelligence
	- computer in a box
	- genetic engineering
	- [[whole brain emulation]]
	- [[collective intelligence]]
- [[cyber]] blend all paths in [[one simple protocol]] with strong focus on [[coordination]]
- [[cyber]] is a protocol
	- for [[collective learning]]
	- of [[simulated brains]]
	- by box computers, superhumans and other living forms
- story
	- [[episode one]] tell us that before deploying [[cyber]] on [[earth]]
	- it is better to start in a greenfield from building
	- superintelligent network state on [[moon]]
	- [[moon]] citizens continuously learn [[bostrom]] [[bootloader]]
	- [[cybercongress]] coordinate game [[age of superintelligence]] for growing the beast
	- [[bootloader]] readiness will start [[episode two]]
	- and earth singleton will be functional
- some properties of [[bostrom]]
	- extremely dynamic and parallel, state of the art [[vimputer]]
	- resilient against [[single point of failure]]
	- have [[essential learning ability]]
	- able to execute [[wasm]] code autonomously
	- collective probabilistic semantic computations in consensus
	- scalable to ~10k tx per second and 1t cyberlinks
	- can ibc with other consensus computers
- [[path to superintelligence]]
	- we want to make it clear that [[cyber]] as protocol is by no means a superintelligence
	- [[superintelligence]] requires [several dozen algorithms](techtree) blended wisely
	- [[superintelligence]] need [[attention]] and [[will]] of millions of the smartest among us
	- but [[cyber]] is the core fundamental mechanism for establishing consensus on [[truth]]
	- we believe this type of consensus allows us to build the superintelligence on top

- discover all [[concepts]]
