alias:: true false problem

- we discussed for a while one property of the [[cyberank]]
- which rise huge concerns into the answering capabilities of [[cyber]]
- lets call it true-false problem
-
- let us imagine that `true` particle have cyberank `10`, and `false` particle have cyberank `9`
- the environment allow to link [[any particle with any]]
- that means that for any questions which cyberlinked to `true` and `false`
- the winning answer will always be `true`
-
- of course such behavior does not feels like something superintelligent
- we always emphasize that [[cyberank]] is a first ranking factor
- but [[not the only one]] which is possible on top the cyber architecture
-
- in order to solve true-false problem
- we have to extend our [[universe model]] into [[two factor]] model
- we must compute [[weights of links]] in a context
-
- [[standard inference]] introduce simplistic algorithm for solving this problem
- giving as result contextual statements which are [[truthful]] by design
