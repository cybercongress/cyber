- insights are the following that [[knowledge graphs]] and [[llms]] are
	- fundamentally different
	- must interact in any [[intelligent]] system
	- key to [[superintelligence]]
- go on to dive into
	- [[cybergraph]] and [[relevance machine]]
	- as beautiful counterpart [[probabilistic model]] for [[llm]]
	- in a modern [[soft3 stack]]
