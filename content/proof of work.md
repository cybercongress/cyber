alias:: pow

- class of [[consensus]] mechanism used in [[blockchains]]
- [[computational power]] which secure creation of new valid [[blocks]]
- unlike [[proof of stake]]
	- which relies on vested staking to assign validation rights
	- pow relies on computational power to solve complex mathematical problems
	- miners compete to solve these problems
	- with the first one to solve it earning the right to validate transactions and create a new block
- method aims to secure the network through [[computational difficulty]] and resource expenditure
- pros
	- security
		- relies on the [[nakamoto]] consensus with an honest majority assumption of 51%
		- making it difficult and costly to attack the network
	- decentralization
		- enables anyone with computational resources to participate
		- without the need for holding a significant amount of tokens
	- fairness
		- allows the network to start from 0 token supply
		- ensuring identical rules for all participants throughout the network's lifetime
	- accessibility
		- enables minting tokens through computational effort
		- acting as a [[transmuter]] to bypass the existing financial system for onboarding
- cons
	- energy efficiency
		- significantly increases energy consumption
		- due to the need for extensive computational power
	- scalability
		- handles lower transaction volumes less efficiently
		- making it less suitable for large-scale blockchain networks
- proof of work is implemented in token of leading [[blockchain]]
