tags:: attack

- type of [[cyber/attacks]] in which a single adversary controls multiple fake identities in a [[network]]
- this term is commonly used in the context of
	- peer-to-peer networks
	- social networks
	- and distributed systems
- key points
	- multiple identities
		- the attacker creates and uses multiple fake identities
		- to gain a disproportionate influence over the network.
	- manipulation
		- these fake identities can be used to manipulate network operations
		- such as voting in [[consensus]] protocols
		- disrupting routing, or spreading misinformation
	- target networks
		- particularly problematic in decentralized systems
		- where trust and identity verification are challenging
		- such as in blockchain networks, peer-to-peer file sharing, and social media platforms
	- detection and prevention:
		- mitigating sybil attacks often involves methods such as
			- identity verification
			- reputation systems
			- [[proof of work]]
			- and network topology analysis
		- to identify and limit the influence of sybil nodes
- example scenario
	- in a peer-to-peer network
	- an attacker could create multiple fake nodes
	- to outvote honest nodes in a decision-making process
	- thereby controlling the outcome
	- and potentially disrupting the network's functionality
- pose significant challenges to maintaining security and trust in distributed systems
- requiring robust strategies to detect and prevent malicious activities
