- conceptual framework or structure
- that is used to describe relationships between graphs
- or to represent higher-level relationships within a single graph
-
- it's essentially a graph of graphs, where each node in the metagraph
- could represent an entire graph or a complex substructure within a larger system
-
- aspects of a metagraph
	- modes represent graphs
		- in a metagraph, the nodes themselves can represent entire graphs or networks
		- this allows for modeling complex systems where each component is itself a complex structure
- edges represent relationships
	- the edges in a metagraph represent relationships between these component graphs
	- these relationships can be as simple as connections
	- or as complex as interactions involving multiple parameters or conditions
- hierarchical structure
	- metagraphs can represent hierarchical structures
	- where each level of the hierarchy represents a different level of abstraction or detail
- applications
	- machine learning
	- data science
	- network theory
	- computational biology
- used in situations where complex systems need to be modeled at multiple levels of abstraction
- provides a way to organize and model complex relationships by considering entire graphs
- as single entities and then analyzing the relationships between these entities
