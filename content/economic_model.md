## economic model

1. **minting for focus computation**  
 neurons that compute focus toward a particle \(P\) earn newly minted cyb.  
 to claim this, a neuron submits *microblocks* containing cyberlinks from neighbouring particles.  
 each valid cyberlink is rewarded in cyb proportional to its contribution to the network’s focus.

2. **staking as delegated attention**  
 neurons stake cyb either on themselves or other neurons, effectively delegating attention.  
 in the special case, stake can be directed toward validators.  
 staking rewards are paid from transaction fees in cyb generated by submitted cyberlinks.

3. **stake distribution over links**  
 by default, a neuron’s effective staked amount is spread evenly across its submitted cyberlinks.  
 however, the neuron can re-weight individual particles or cyberlinks, assigning a percentage of its stake to specific targets.  
 this allows for safe stake/unstake operations and smooth delegation without breaking the neuron’s internal focus model.

4. **permanent weighting via burn**  
 a neuron may burn cyb to grant *eternal weight* to a particle.  
 this irreversible act permanently increases that particle’s importance in the collective focus \(\pi\), anchoring critical knowledge in the network.

5. **link fees and net rewards**  
 submitting a cyberlink incurs a small fee to deter spam.  
 links that accumulate sufficient attention and verification may yield a net positive reward over time as the focus field converges.

6. **attention yield curve**  
 earlier and more accurate cyberlinks to high-\(\pi\) particles earn proportionally greater rewards as collective focus evolves, incentivising discovery and precision.

7. **reputation emergence**  
 a neuron’s long-term reputation is measured by the accumulated \(\pi\)-weight of particles it has contributed to, aligning social and economic capital.
