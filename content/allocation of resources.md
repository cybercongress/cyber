- 25 %: scalable alignment and interpretability:
	- invest in mechanistic interpretability, agent foundations, preference learning and formal verification tools that keep any path to superintelligence on track for human values. these efforts protect returns across all ai architectures.
- 20 % neuromorphic and analog hardware
	- back teams translating brain-inspired and mixed-signal computing into chips that run spiking or diffusion-style workloads orders of magnitude more efficiently than digital gpus. if ffc stalls, ultra-low-power spiking nets or analog accelerators remain a viable superintelligence substrate.
- 15 % quantum computing with error correction
	- fund logical qubit prototypes, cryogenic control stacks and algorithms for chemistry and optimisation. even modest, application-specific quantum speedups could upend the competitive landscape by 2035.
- 10 % focus flow computation
	- research portfolio and seed funding toward ffc‑based superintelligence
- 10 % decentralised cryptographic computing
	- support zero-knowledge proof systems, verifiable delay functions and layer-2 rollups. these tools enable trust-minimised markets and autonomous coordination—critical infrastructure for any future where superintelligence mediates economic activity.
- 10 % advanced energy systems
	- allocate to compact fusion concepts, high-temperature superconductors, and long-duration storage. abundant, clean energy is a force multiplier for all compute-heavy paths, including ffc.
- 8 % bio-digital convergence
	- nurture programmable cell factories, dna data storage and brain–computer interface research. biological substrates can complement silicon limits and open routes to hybrid wet-ware cognition.
- 7 % resilience and security research
	- focus on adversarial robustness, formal methods for cyber-physical safety, and supply-chain hardening. these reduce tail-risk scenarios where breakthroughs are undermined by failures or attacks.
- 5 % moonshot frontier math and theory
	- seed small teams exploring novel paradigms—category-theoretic models, topological quantum field computing, or entirely new substrate theories. returns are low probability but potentially unbounded.
