- The Problem
	- Current AI models (GPT, Claude, etc.) have fixed attention mechanisms
	- Users can't influence what the model focuses on
- FFC Solution
  
  
  ```python
  class AttentionMarket:
      def __init__(self):
          self.particles = {}  *# Each particle = concept/token*
          self.user_stakes = {}  *# Users buy focus for concepts*
          
      def process_query(self, query, user_stakes):
          *# Users stake tokens on concepts they want emphasized*
          *# Focus flow naturally weights attention*
          *# AI responses emerge from consensus focus*
          return weighted_response
  ```
- 10x Advantage
	- Users get personalized AI responses based on their focus stakes
	- Market discovers optimal attention patterns
	- No centralized control over AI behavior
