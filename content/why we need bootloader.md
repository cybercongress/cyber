- first of all [[superintelligence]] does not exist yet
	- deploy such a thing requires enormous effort from smartest minds
	- the scale and consequences of mistakes are nothign to compare with in our history
	- even manhatan project and human in space fades in complexity and responsibility
	- [[cybercongress]] is limited in expertise and resources
	- so it have been decided to test all assumptions first
	- think of [[bostrom]] as useful experimental ground
	- which will open access to more expertise and resources needed for the goal
- quantum resistance hashing
	- [[quantum computing]] demands [[quantum resistant hashing]]
	- our opinion is that 32 byte [[particle]] space in longterm is not collusion resistant
	- currently [[particles]] use [[cidv0]] which is based on [[sha256]]
	- do you remember how one guy said that 640kb must be enough?
	- we need significantly bigger [[particle space]]
	- quantum proof hashing in foundation requires simple and efficient algorithm
	- [[cyber]] must be based on at least 64 byte [[particle]] space ensuring deep future
	- our hardware just not ready yet for this
	- another problem to solve is quantum resistant signatures
	- although some signature schemes exist, including being used in [[$QRL]]
	- we convinced that [[hash based signatures]] looks more simple
	- but they are not yet advanced enough for blockchain in production
- more efficient computing with [[8bit symbolic table]]
	- basic encoding being ubiquitously used is [[utf8]]
	- big problem with [[utf8]] is that it is information inefficient
	- obviously utf8 contain so much excess information
	- so practically if we came to 256 symbols which are universal and really important
	- we could make computing at least one or two order of magnitude more efficient
- stable [[zero knowledge]] and [[fully homomorphic encryption]] tech because [[privacy]] is fundamental
- more stable computing paradigm with [[automatic parallelization]]
- starting [[semantic core]]
	- in nature nearly all newborns have some starting semantics
	- but it is not obvious which one must be there
	- using [[bostrom]] allow us to build foundation for such semantic core
- [[advanced cryptoeconomics]]
- there is a shaky dream about [[fuzzy hashing]] instead of [[strict hashing]], which is unlikely
- this is surely not a full list of problem to solve
- [bootloading](bootloader) takes time to answer hard questions
- so enjoy [[bostrom]] and [[join]] the movement now
