decision vectors for a focus‑driven, layered cybergraph (10 tb/s)

purpose

turn the whole chat into one self‑contained blueprint. include hybrid consensus, gpu path to sub‑second ux, semantic rollups, ibc supply‑rank, lane economics, convergence math, storage budget, and scaling to ~10 tb/s.

axioms we agreed on

• focus is not just a number; it is a flow with memoisation and fraud‑detectable deltas.
• sub‑second path is mandatory; do not assume absence of gpu.
• economics are part of consensus: price, priority, and rewards follow focus.
• horizontal scale beats vertical: many sovereign networks sync their semantics, not raw edges.

core targets

| metric | target |
|---|---|
| ingest | 10 tb/s aggregate across networks |
| optimistic local finality | ≤ 0.5 s |
| global supply‑rank sync | ≤ 3 s end‑to‑end |
| links/second at 10 tb/s | ≈ 2.1 × 10^8 (48 b/link) |
| rolling hot window | 90 days |
| gpu per hot rollup | 1–2 consumer gpus |
| regional hubs | 3–6 (amer, emea, apac, …) |

crypto‑economic clarity (from early design)

• da fees → da operators (lane‑specific).
• ordering fees → dag workers.
• finality fees → avalanche samplers (weighted by accuracy).
• focus validators earn weight‑accuracy rewards; slashing on provable mis‑ranking.

hybrid consensus stack

• dag mempool (narwhal‑class) with focus‑weighted qos and gpu batch sort.
• fast‑path bft (bullshark‑class) for sub‑second commits.
• fallback polls (avalanche snowman‑class) to maintain liveness under partitions.
• asynchronous backing‑style batching to create deterministic snapshots for reward/settlement.
• optional cerberus‑style cross‑shards for atomic updates of topic buckets.

sub‑second gpu pipeline (reference path ≈ 480 ms)

• 80 ms micro‑slot: gather tx; gpu verifies sigs and sorts by focus.
• 160 ms dag round: build causal layer; gpu blake3/merkle.
• 320 ms vote: bullshark fast‑path; avalanche poll starts if needed.
• 480 ms notarise + da: post blob header; stream erasure‑coded shares; write Δ‑rank to compute shard.

multi‑frequency cadence

| layer | tick | action |
|---|---|---|
| worker | per tx (10–50 ms) | attach focus tag; local qos |
| primary | dag round (200–400 ms) | incremental pagerank over new edges; emit Δ‑vector |
| commit | 1–2 s | aggregate deltas; forward to shard |
| batch | 6 s | deterministic on‑chain snapshot; settle rewards |
| macro | 5–10 min | re‑tune qos/fees; push thresholds |

focus improves every layer

• da: namespaces carry focus; high‑focus gets priority gossip and deeper sampling; fee rebates by percentile.
• ordering: mempool sorts by focus; under load drop bottom x% to bound latency.
• finality: sampler probability weighted by historical accuracy; quicker quorums for honest rankers.
• shard allocation: moving‑average focus rents more cores to hot topics.

semantic rollups

• one rollup per semantic bucket (merge/split on load).
• each rollup runs its own gpu incremental rank and posts compressed Δ‑rank to da.
• proofs + receipts settle via ibc; local queries answer using local rank ⊕ last global snapshot.

ibc supply‑rank hub (cross‑network sync)

• message: MsgSupplyRank { bucket_id, delta, proof, fee }.
• ordered channels with ics‑23 proofs; batches every 200–400 ms.
• hub state small (10k–100k buckets) → 1–2 s bft finality.
• chains pull GlobalRankSnapshot every ~1–3 s; merge locally.
• fees paid by senders; hub redistributes 90% as rewards by global demand.

lane matrix (da layering)

| lane | sustained bw | latency | role |
|---|---|---|---|
| hot‑slot | ≥100 mb/s per cluster | <0.5 s | top 0.1% focus blobs |
| warm‑dag | ≈16 gb/s per shard | 0.6–2 s | next 10% focus |
| cold‑chunk | 1–2 gb/s per lane | multi‑second | long‑tail links |
| archival | push only | hours | snapshots to object/tape |

geographic and semantic stratification

• region meshes (≤30 ms rtt) emit merkle roots globally every ~400 ms.
• high‑fan‑out micro‑edges downsample to macro counters before da.
• dedupe near‑duplicates; single store for shared embeddings; reference edges for repeats.

throughput math and storage budget

• at 1 gb/s per chain: ≈ 20.8 m links/s; ≈ 657 t links/year.
• raw store 48 b/link → ≈ 31.5 pb/year (≈ 29.4 pib/year).
• da 2× redundancy + headers + proofs → hot set ≈ 60–70 pb; cold archive compressed → ≈ 12 pb/year.
• unit note: 1 pib ≈ 1.125 pb.

convergence math and gpu bill

exact cold‑start (global sweep)

• edges ≈ 6.6 × 10^14; 15–30 passes; ≈ 1.6 × 10^7 gpu‑seconds.
• 15‑minute rebuild → ≈ 18k a100‑class gpus.

hierarchical + stochastic approximations

• cluster coarsening ≈ 1000× shrink of super‑graph.
• monte‑carlo/forward‑push per cluster: ≈ 160 s on 1k gpus for whole graph.
• streaming incremental per 80 ms slot: <10 ms on 1 gpu; two gpus give head‑room.

scaling to ~10 tb/s aggregate

• many semantic rollups across sovereign networks; focus router assigns lane per percentile.
• regional hubs (20 worldwide) aggregate Δ locally; three global hubs reconcile.
• gpu count network‑wide ≈ 3k–5k high‑end cards; cold lanes cpu‑only.
• end‑to‑end tx → global rank ≈ 2–3 s at scale; local hot queries <0.3 s.

hardware profile

• hot rollup: 2× rtx‑class gpus, nvme, 100 gbit nic.
• warm rollup: 1× rtx‑class gpu.
• cold rollup: cpu boxes + big hdds.
• hubs/backbone: cpu bft; 1 gpu for nightly sanity sweeps.

observability and slos

| slo | target |
|---|---|
| p95 local commit | ≤ 0.5 s |
| p95 global rank update | ≤ 3 s |
| da lane utilisation | ≤ 70% |
| rank drift/hour | ≤ 1e‑3 l1 |
| ibc packet failure | ≤ 1e‑4 / 1e6 packets |

failure modes and fallbacks

• da congestion → raise lane fees; widen batches; spill to next lane.
• dag stall → avalanche fallback; slower commits, no halts.
• regional partition → keep local supply‑rank; reconcile on rejoin.
• oracle attack → slash; down‑weight sampler; rotate committee.

implementation rules (prioritised)

1. always attach focus tags at the edge; drop lowest x% under load.
2. keep incremental pagerank memory‑resident; no copies between kernels.
3. write Δ‑rank on‑chain only at 6 s batch to bound gas; stream micro‑rewards off‑chain each micro‑slot.
4. lane cut‑offs are autotuned to hold ≤70% utilisation.
5. fraud proofs for rank deltas first; zk proofs later per lane.
6. ibc packets cap at 64 kb; aggregate every 200–400 ms.
7. treat units clearly (pb vs pib); report both in dashboards.

benchmarks we must ship

• 80 ms slot at 50k tx/slot; measure p99 gpu time and end‑to‑end commit.
• celestia/eigenda/avail lane soak tests to rated throughput.
• regional hub with 1000 rollups; measure Δ‑rank latency and ibc loss.
• hourly hierarchical correction vs drift; target ≤1e‑3 l1.
• avalanche‑weighted sampling vs uniform; target <800 ms fallback finality.

closing note

this document consolidates all chat insights: hybrid consensus with avalanche fallback; gpu pipeline at ~480 ms; focus‑driven qos and pricing; semantic rollups and ibc supply‑rank; hierarchical/stochastic convergence; lane economics; regional hubs; throughput, storage, and gpu math. adjust lane mix and bucket taxonomy to the first pilot’s real traffic, then scale horizontally.
