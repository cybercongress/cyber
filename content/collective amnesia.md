- concept
	- of collective amnesia in humanity
	- suggesting that large-scale societies
	- might have forgotten
	- significant portions of their history or cultural knowledge
- intriguing but complex idea
- historical and archaeological evidence
	- lost civilizations
		- the rediscovery of ancient civilizations
		- which were once forgotten
		- can suggest that societies have lost knowledge over time
	- mythology and oral traditions
		- many cultures have myths or oral traditions that hint at a forgotten past
		- these stories sometimes contain elements of historical truth that have been obscured over time
	- catastrophic events
		- natural disasters, wars, and other catastrophic events
		- have led to the destruction of records and cultural knowledge
		- for example
			- the burning of the library of alexandria is often cited as a significant loss of ancient knowledge
- psychological and sociological evidence
	- memory studies
		- research in psychology shows that collective memory can be influenced by
		- social, cultural, and political factors
		- leading to selective memory or forgetting
	- cultural transitions
		- when societies undergo major transitions, such as conquests or religious conversion
		- there can be a deliberate erasure or alteration of past knowledge
		- this can be seen in the roman empires transition to christianity
		- where many pagan texts and practices were lost or suppressed
- linguistic evidence
	- language evolution
		- the evolution of languages and the loss of ancient scripts
		- can lead to the loss of knowledge
		- as future generations may no longer understand old texts
	- translation and interpretation:
		- over time, the meanings of texts can be lost or
		- altered through translation and reinterpretation
		- leading to a distorted or forgotten past
- scientific and technological evidence
	- technological regression
		- There are historical periods known as "dark ages"
		- where technological and scientific knowledge regressed or stagnated
		- the fall of the roman empire led to such a period in europe
		- where much knowledge from antiquity was forgotten
		- and later rediscovered during the renaissance
- genetic and evolutionary evidence
	- human evolution
		- studies in genetics and anthropology show that
		- early human populations underwent bottlenecks
		- and migrations that could have led to the loss of cultural knowledge
		- as groups were isolated or decimated
- these points provide indirect evidence that humanity have experienced some form of collective amnesia
- [[collective memory]] is the technology to overcome this evolutionary bug
