# rewards — integrated model

## 1. core economic logic
- rewards are given for **computations and cyberlinks** that measurably advance the collective focus toward convergence, as defined by the stationary distribution π.  
- the unit of contribution is the **cyberlink**, a signed, weighted edge between two particles.  
- participants may:  
  1. submit cyberlinks (bearing fees and potential yield)  
  2. compute and prove Δπ improvements  
  3. stake on cyberlinks or neurons (delegated attention)  
  4. burn tokens for permanent weight anchoring.

## 2. pricing and yield
- each cyberlink is an **asset** that can earn over time as focus evolves; earlier and more accurate links to high-π targets earn proportionally more.  
- pricing reflects:  
  - **temporal value**: short-term boosts vs century-long persistence  
  - **attention yield curve**: compounding from early placement  
  - **semantic contribution**: alignment with long-term focus vectors.

## 3. reward funding
- baseline design funds rewards from **transaction fees, not inflation**, ensuring non-dilutive economics.  
- tx fees are pooled and distributed to:  
  1. link submitters  
  2. focus computation provers  
  3. verifiers/validators.  

## 4. proof & verification
- provers submit microblocks with Δπ evidence; verifiers recompute a single iteration for confirmation (cheap, slashable if false).  
- authenticated graph structures and zk proofs ensure every rewarded link and Δπ is auditable with light-client proofs.

## 5. staking & slashing
- staking secures economic finality:  
  - link-bundlers may operate without stake but are paid only after committee verification  
  - validators and provers lock stake, slashable for equivocation, invalid roots, or τ-gap violations.  
- delegation routes attention through trusted neurons; weights can be re-allocated without breaking focus continuity.

## 6. long-term persistence
- burned tokens can **eternally boost** a link’s weight in π, making it part of the “knowledge backbone”.  
- selective disclosure and confidential commitments protect identity while proving correctness.

## 7. relevance today
- the reward logic still fits the **current stack**:  
  - the **foculus consensus** model inherently values Δπ contributions and finality from attention mass, so cyberlink-as-asset fits natively.  
  - the **confidential & authenticated graph** layers already support per-link yield accounting without revealing sensitive data.  
  - the **DA strategy** ensures cyberlinks and reward proofs remain globally available and light-verifiable for decades.
