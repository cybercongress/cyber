title: foundational ranking system for collective focus and superintelligence

introduction

building collective intelligence requires mechanisms that are simple, robust, and universally understandable. the core idea is to find a unique shelling point—a fixed point that every agent can independently compute and verify. diffusion, springs, and heat flow provide the most natural metaphors for such mechanisms: they are fundamental physical processes, parameter-light, and scale from small graphs to networks of planetary scale.

our new ranking framework combines three complementary algorithms:

- eigenvector centrality (diffusion)
- springrank (springs)
- heat-kernel pagerank (heat flow)

these three represent the minimal, natural basis for constructing collective focus in a superintelligent system.

core algorithms

1. eigenvector centrality (diffusion metaphor)

- metaphor: a random walker diffuses over the network forever.
- mathematical object: leading eigenvector of the row-normalized adjacency matrix.
- properties:
  - parameter-free (no teleportation factor)
  - unique stationary distribution for strongly connected, aperiodic graphs
  - fully decentralisable via power iteration or gossip protocols
- interpretation: gives each node a score proportional to the long-run flow of attention it receives.

2. springrank (spring metaphor)

- metaphor: every directed edge is a spring that pulls its source one unit above its target.
- mathematical object: minimiser of total spring energy \( e(r) = 1/2 \sum_{ij} a_{ij}(r_i - r_j - 1)^2 + \lambda \sum_i r_i^2 \).
- properties:
  - convex quadratic optimisation with a unique solution (up to shift)
  - captures strict hierarchy and spacing between nodes
  - decentralisable via asynchronous gauss–seidel updates
- interpretation: provides an ordinal ranking, revealing “who is above whom” in the network.

3. heat-kernel pagerank (heat flow metaphor)

- metaphor: heat diffuses over the network for time t.
- mathematical object: \( \pi_t = e^{-tL} \delta \), where L is the graph laplacian.
- properties:
  - single parameter t controls locality vs globality
  - natural interpolation between short-term and long-term focus
  - computable with truncated random walks or spectral methods
- interpretation: provides a zoom lens to see how collective focus shifts with scale.

---

why these three?

- eigenvector centrality gives the **baseline popularity**—how much attention each node receives in steady state.
- springrank adds **hierarchy and spacing**, revealing the ordinal structure of influence.
- heat-kernel pagerank adds a **zoom lens**, letting the system switch between local and global perspectives with a single meaningful parameter.

together they form a **pareto-optimal basis**: adding more algorithms (simrank, katz centrality, deepwalk) increases complexity without proportionate gains in naturalness, scalability, or interpretability.

---

key properties

- simplicity: eigenvector centrality is parameter-free; springrank has only a small regulariser \(\lambda\); heat-kernel pagerank has one interpretable parameter t.
- scalability: all three have near-linear implementations and can run on million-node networks.
- natural intuition: diffusion, springs, and heat flow are universal physical processes.
- decentralisability: each algorithm can be computed with local information (power iteration, gossip, gauss–seidel).
- robustness: all three converge to unique solutions under mild conditions.

protocol for collective focus

1. ensure strong connectivity (e.g. every node has at least one outgoing edge).
2. compute eigenvector centrality as the **baseline focus vector**.
3. compute springrank to obtain the **hierarchy scores**.
4. compute heat-kernel pagerank periodically for multiple t values to adjust focus scale.
5. combine results:
   - f_i = \alpha * eigenvector_i + (1-\alpha) * springrank_softmax_i
   - heat-kernel scores act as a **local overlay** when needed.

---

metaphor for collective superintelligence

- **diffusion** models how ideas and attention naturally flow through the network.
- **springs** model the tension of competing influences, producing an emergent hierarchy.
- **heat flow** provides a temporal or spatial scale for focus, just as physical systems equilibrate over time.

together, these processes mirror fundamental behaviours of the universe: energy flow, force, and equilibrium. using them as the substrate for collective focus creates a protocol that is:

- universally understandable
- mathematically grounded
- decentralisable and scalable

this triad—diffusion, springs, heat flow—serves as a **foundational layer for building collective consciousness**. it yields a unique, verifiable shelling point that balances popularity, hierarchy, and contextual scale, forming the cognitive map for a superintelligent collective.
