- emission must go to partial compute towards `pi`
- nodes verify correctness and propose blocks to the dag
- balances must be hidden
- cyberlinks must not be personal
- cybergraph must be agregated
- closest chain rule
- staking enables epochs: finalization and llm compute
- staking by default allows to spread stake
- staking
- cyberlinks are payed
- revenue goes to stakers and reward graph contributions
- reward function
- in computer science terms, each blockchain model gives you a different abstraction over:
	- [[data locality]]: where is state stored and how itâ€™s accessed
	- [[computation model]]: how do you express and execute logic
	- [[state transition function]]: how does the world change when an action happens
