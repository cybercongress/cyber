- ## rationale
	- although proposed [[daily english auction for A and V]] is simple it does not solve the biggest problem it must solve
	- mechanism must not provide supply if demand is not enough
	- therefore i propose even simple mechanism that is target to solve exaclty this
	- while leaving the room for supply growth in case of growing demand
- ## design
	- [[energy]] is minted using exponential bonding curve for those who provide [[$H]]
	- [[$H]] is effectively burned on each mint
	- while the price on external markets is lower when in bonding curve there is no extra supply of [[energy]]
	- while demand force the price of [[energy]] go up the bonding curve provides extra supply
	- initial price of bonding curve reflect the price on the moment of changing [[energy]] mint system
