alias:: cyberlinks weight, cyberlinks weights

-
- algorithm addressed to solve [[true false problem]] for inference of truthful [[answers]] from [[cybergraph]]
- algorithm features
	- does not introduce additional complexity
	- requires zero additional information
	- follow occam razor principle, that is it is as dumb and simple as possible
	-
- algorithm
	- get all [[particles]] cyberlinked with asking [[particle]] sorted by [[cyberank]]
		- for each [[particle]] get all [[cyberlinks]]
			- for each [[cyberlink]] get [[neuron]]
				- for each [[neuron]]
					- get [[will]] balance
					- get number of [[cyberlinks]]
					- compute average [[will]] per cyberlink
			- sum ([[average will]]) votes for every [[particle]]
- multiplay [[cyberank]] of each particle by sum ([[average will]])
-
- in essence we weight [[will]] of neurons on global [[attention]] in [[context]]
-
- any intelligent system must solve [[true false problem]] for [[contextual awareness]]
