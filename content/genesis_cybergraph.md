# Genesis Cybergraph: Foundational Semantic Core

## Purpose
The genesis cybergraph should embed a minimal yet universal semantic core, enabling the network to self-organize, learn, and scale without replacing early primitives. This core must:

- Provide **irreducible building blocks** for computation, reasoning, and consensus.
- Encode **universal processes** found in nature and cognition.
- Be **cryptographically verifiable**, **quantum-resilient**, and **privacy-preserving** from inception.

## Philosophical Foundation
The semantic substrate will model three Pareto-optimal primitives that appear across physics, biology, and information systems:

1. **Diffusion** — irreversible spreading, exploration, entropy growth.
2. **Springs** — reversible oscillation, equilibrium restoration.
3. **Heat Flow** — energy redistribution, dissipation, contextual scaling.

This triad forms a universal basis for transport, storage, and dissipation of energy and information, mapping directly to:
- **Attention flow** (diffusion)
- **Structural balance & hierarchy** (springs)
- **Contextual scaling and relevance decay** (heat flow)

## Mathematical Core
The collective focus theorem (CFT) defines consensus as convergence of a token-weighted random walk over a strongly connected graph to a stationary distribution π. Finality occurs when a node's π exceeds a dynamic threshold τ.

Genesis embeds:
- **Particle**: Content-addressed node (data, code, concept).
- **Cyberlink**: Signed, weighted edge (intent, relation, proof).
- **Neuron**: Cryptographic agent controlling stake, emitting links.
- **Token**: Attention weight influencing traversal probability.
- **Focus vector π**: Emergent consensus on significance.
- **Threshold τ**: Safety bound for finality.

## Core Relations & Semantics
The genesis graph must define a *minimal ontology* of edge types:

1. **is_a / type_of** — semantic classification.
2. **part_of / contains** — composition and modularity.
3. **causes / results_in** — causal or logical dependency.
4. **endorses / refutes** — trust and reputation signals.
5. **derives_from / generalizes** — lineage and abstraction.
6. **links_to** — generic association.

Each edge is a **proof particle**: it carries both a semantic type and cryptographic evidence.

## Cryptographic & Privacy Layer
Genesis must start with:
- **BLAKE3-XOF-512** digests for all Merkle nodes (post-quantum headroom).
- **Pedersen commitments** for edge weights (perfectly hiding, homomorphic).
- **Poseidon2 tags** for in-circuit verification.
- **Selective disclosure API** for revealing subgraphs/audit trails without deanonymization.

## Economic Anchors
The economic layer links minting to changes in π:
```
reward(p) ∝ Δπ(p)
```
- Minted tokens only for focus updates that shift π significantly.
- All other proof types rewarded from fees.
- Damping factor γ to allow network memory to adapt.

## Data Availability Strategy
Genesis DA parameters:
- **Tier 0**: Ethereum calldata roots (critical recovery).
- **Tier 1**: Active graph in Celestia with light-client verification.
- **Tier 2**: Archival to Filecoin/IPFS.

## Initial Genesis Ontology Snapshot
At genesis, seed the cybergraph with high-level universal concepts:
- **Physical processes**: diffusion, oscillation, dissipation.
- **Logical primitives**: true, false, cause, effect.
- **Social primitives**: identity, trust, value.
- **Mathematical primitives**: number, function, set, vector.

Each with `is_a`, `part_of`, `causes`, and `endorses` edges to form a coherent, expandable kernel.

## Rationale
By embedding universal physical and cognitive primitives into the genesis state, the protocol ensures:
- Early queries and reasoning have a shared reference frame.
- Emergent intelligence inherits proven stability patterns.
- The system remains auditable, adaptable, and semantically extensible without breaking consensus.
