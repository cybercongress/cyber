- cyber energy is [[fuel]], [[will]] and [[attention]]
- its a package of 3 derived [[consensus tokens]] needed for [[soft3]]
-
- package can be sold by anyone for any [[cyber-sdk]] based [[vimputer]]
-
- in [[bostrom]] cyber energy are the following [[tokens]]
	- [[$H]]: [[fuel]]
	- [[$V]]: [[will]]
	- [[$A]]: [[attention]]
- in [[spacepussy]]
	- [[$CUM]]: [[fuel]]
	- [[$VIP]]: [[will]]
	- [[$AM]]: [[attention]]
-
- usually [[vimputers]] use one token for [[gas]] and the same token for [[security]]
-
- [[consensus]] of [[cyber-sdk]] is different and is practically 4 [[consensus tokens]]
	- have several computing resources
	- both [[sequential and parallel]]
	- also we [[decoupling security and gas]]
	- hence require several [[tokens]] for operations
-
- although such approach add some complexity
- its needed in terms of [[computing]]
-
- TODO remove cognitive stupor of 3 tokens with good [[gamification]]: [[buy energy]] in [[cyb]]
