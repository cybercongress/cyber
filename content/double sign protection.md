- mitigation of [[nothing at stake]] problem
  an integral security mechanism in consensus algorithms, such as [[tendermint]]
- that detects and penalizes validators
	- who sign two different blocks
	- at the same height
- this mechanism ensures network security and integrity by
	- detection
		- monitoring the blockchain for instances
		- where a validator signs conflicting blocks at the same height
	- penalty
		- enforcing slashing
		- which involves automatically reducing the staked tokens of the offending validator
		- as a deterrent against dishonest behavior
	- removal
		- potentially removing the validator from the active validator set
		- to prevent further malicious actions
- these measures are designed
	- to discourage validators from attempting [[double signing attack]]
	- thereby maintaining the [[liveness]] and [[safety]] of the [[blockchain]] network
- [[params]]
	- [[slash fraction double sign]]
