# active inference x cft: summary and integration plan

## executive summary

- active inference gives a single principle for agents to perceive, learn, and act by minimising variational free energy.

- cft models collective attention as token-weighted random walks converging to a stationary distribution (collective focus).

- fusing them yields a self-configuring network where each neuron updates beliefs and adjusts links to lower expected free energy, improving stability, curiosity, and robustness.

- precision (confidence) becomes an on-chain economic signal that prices prediction errors and filters noise.

## key mappings between active inference and cft

- hidden states ↔ latent attributes of particles and edges in the cybergraph

- observations ↔ measured traffic of random walks, link arrivals, weight changes

- generative model ↔ each neuron's local probabilistic model of link dynamics and token flows

- prediction error ↔ divergence between expected focus distribution and realised traffic

- precision (confidence) ↔ adaptive token staking and edge weights that amplify trusted signals

- free energy ↔ upper bound on global uncertainty over graph states; minimised at focus convergence

## minimal algorithmic spec

- belief representation: variational posterior q_θ(z) over latent graph states z per neuron; parameters θ stored locally.

- free energy: F = Eq_θ[−log p(s, z)] + H[q_θ], with s the local observations (traffic, link events). goal is to reduce F.

- expected free energy for planning: G(π) = risk + ambiguity ≈ Eq[−log p(preferred s | z)] + Eq[H[p(s | z)]], guiding policy π over link edits and sampling actions.

- precision control: learn/logit-scale precisions λ for different error channels; use soft attention to weight updates.

- hierarchical markov blankets: discover clusters (modules) with dense internal edges; perform message passing within and between blankets for scalability.

### reference update loop (pseudocode)

```
for epoch in epochs:
  for neuron i in graph:
    s_i ← observe(local traffic, link arrivals, token flows)
    \hat{s}_i ← predict via generative model
    ε_i ← s_i − \hat{s}_i                      # prediction error
    θ_i ← θ_i − η_θ * ∇_θ F(s_i; θ_i, λ_i)     # perception / learning
    λ_i ← λ_i − η_λ * ∇_λ F                    # precision tuning
    a_i ← argmin_π G_i(π; θ_i, λ_i)            # choose action policy
    execute(a_i)                               # edit edges, stake, sample
```

## integration roadmap

- modelling
  - define a neurally inspired generative model p(s, z) for link dynamics conditioned on local focus, trending content cues, and governance events.
  
  - specify preference distributions over observations (e.g., high-quality citations, low spam entropy) to ground goal-directed behaviour.
  
- protocol layer
  - add a lightweight variational message-passing step to the existing compute kernel so neurons exchange sufficient statistics before committing writes.
  
  - implement precision-weighted staking where tokens back the reliability of subgraphs and price prediction-error channels.
  
- scalability
  - form markov-blanket modules via community detection; schedule intra-module updates at high frequency and inter-module updates at lower frequency.
  
  - use sparse, low-rank approximations for θ and amortised inference for q_θ(z) to keep costs bounded.
  
- evaluation
  - run ablations on the test-net comparing baseline cft vs cft + active inference on convergence speed, adversarial resilience, retrieval accuracy, and compute cost.
  
  - track free-energy and precision maps as primary diagnostics.
  
## expected benefits and risks

- benefits
  - faster, more stable convergence under uncertainty and drift
  
  - intrinsic curiosity drives exploration without central control
  
  - robustness: anomalous regions get down-weighted via precision control
  
  - interpretability: free-energy heatmaps show why attention moves
  
- risks / mitigations
  - overfitting preferences: adopt plural preference priors and rotate committees
  
  - precision gaming: require skin-in-the-game with slashing on bad forecasts; diversify error channels
  
  - compute overhead: amortise inference, cache sufficient statistics, schedule updates asynchronously
  
## open research questions

- what precision-staking regime best aligns epistemic efficiency with token economics under real traffic?

- where are phase transitions in emergent intelligence when adding hierarchical markov blankets to cft?

- how to calibrate preference distributions without central authority while avoiding sybil manipulation?

- which approximate-inference methods (e.g., natural gradients, lo-fi variational families) give the best performance-compute tradeoff on very large graphs?

## immediate next actions

- formalise a concrete free-energy objective for the current cyberrank kernel and derive local gradients.

- prototype the message-passing layer on a small subgraph and measure free-energy descent and retrieval quality.

- design and test precision-weighted staking rules with simulated adversaries before on-chain trials.

- prepare ablation metrics, dashboards, and free-energy map visualisations for the next test-net cycle.
