# Protocol

The repo is a collection of mission critical information on the Cyber project. The purpose of the repo is to form both social and technical consensus on the project. The technical is more about having a protocol spec which is possible to implement on any language. The social is more about the common vision aka shelling point for every involved party.

## Computing the knowledge of the Great Web

Is a  [whitepaper](/computing-the-knowledge/computing-the-knowledge.md)  describing a protocol framework. Research focusing on establishing the most important concepts and its rationale.

## Story
