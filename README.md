The repo is a collection of mission critical information on the cyber project.

The purpose of the repo is to form both social and technical consensus on the project.

The technical aspect is more about having a protocol spec which is possible to implement in any formal language.

The social aspect is more about the common vision aka shelling point for every involved party, expanding protocol definition to answer the `why` question.

Information is structured in a [logseq](https://logseq.com/) knowledge graph notation.

## Legacy

The [computing the knowledge](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyber/tree/master/computing-the-knowledge) folder stores the [prelaunch whitepaper](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyber/blob/master/computing-the-knowledge/computing-the-knowledge.md) which is [conserved](https://cyb.ai/oracle/ask/QmXzGkfxZV2fzpFmq7CjAYsYL1M581ZD4yuF9jztPVTpCn) due to a lot of incoming links.

Although this whitepaper grasps the idea, since then, the project has evolved quite far from the vision. 

Please refer to this metagraph for comprehensive information on the project.
